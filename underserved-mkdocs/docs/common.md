Individuals and NGOs can fall victim to a wide range of cyber attacks. This section focuses on the most common attack types (or vectors) to help raise awareness and improve reporting.

The MISP-Forms service provides a structured set of forms designed to facilitate the reporting of these incidents. This guide will help you accurately identify, understand, and report cyberattacks, ensuring that key details are captured effectively.

Additionally, general guidance on recovery and mitigation strategies will be provided. However, as every NGO operates in a unique environment, these recommendations will remain high-level and should be adapted to specific organisational needs.
