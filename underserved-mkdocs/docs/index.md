The Underserved Platform is designed to provide a streamlined and user-friendly way to report cyberattacks. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and services to ensure that reports contain the necessary details for effective action by law enforcement and other relevant authorities.

A common challenge in cyberattack reporting is the lack of critical details, which can hinder investigations and response efforts. The Underserved Platform addresses this issue by guiding users through a structured reporting process to enhance the quality and usefulness of submitted reports.

This guide will walk you through the platformâ€™s features, how to use them effectively, and best practices for maximising their impact.
