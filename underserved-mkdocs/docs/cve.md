Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE)

### What is a CVE?
A Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) is a publicly disclosed security flaw in software or hardware that could be exploited by attackers. Each CVE is assigned a unique identifier to help security professionals track and manage vulnerabilities.

CVE records are maintained by the MITRE Corporation in collaboration with the cybersecurity community and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

## How Are CVEs Identified?
Each CVE entry includes:
- CVE ID – A unique identifier (e.g., `CVE-2024-12345`).
- Description – A summary of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Affected Products – The software, hardware, or systems impacted.
- Severity Rating – A risk score, often measured using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
- References – Links to official advisories, patches, and security analysis.

### Example CVE entry: CVE-2023-12345

CVE-2023-12345 is a critical buffer overflow vulnerability in XYZ software could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### How Are CVEs Used in Cybersecurity?
#### 1. Vulnerability Management
- Organisations use CVEs to identify and patch security weaknesses before attackers exploit them.
- CVEs help in risk assessment, prioritising which vulnerabilities need immediate attention.

#### 2. Threat Intelligence
- Security teams track CVEs to understand potential attack vectors.
- Tools like MISP, Shodan, and CVE databases help in monitoring known vulnerabilities.

#### 3. Security Compliance
- Many compliance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR) require organisations to monitor and mitigate CVEs.
- Regulatory bodies may issue alerts for critical CVEs that affect public safety.

### Where to Find CVE Information
- [MITRE CVE Database](https://cve.mitre.org/)
- [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- [Exploit Database (Offensive Security)](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

Security professionals and NGOs should regularly monitor CVEs to protect against known threats.

### How to Mitigate CVEs
To reduce the risk of cyber attacks related to CVEs, organisations should:
✅ Apply security patches as soon as they are released.  
✅ Use vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to detect unpatched systems.  
✅ Restrict internet exposure for vulnerable services.  
✅ Follow security advisories from vendors and security agencies.  
✅ Implement multi-layered security measures, including firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

CVE records are essential for cybersecurity. They provide a standard way to track vulnerabilities, allowing organisations to:
- Stay informed about security risks.
- Patch systems to prevent exploitation.
- Improve overall cyber resilience.

By monitoring and responding to CVEs, NGOs and businesses can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks.
