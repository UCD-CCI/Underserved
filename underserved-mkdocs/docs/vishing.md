### Mitigate the Risk of Vishing Attacks

Preventing vishing attacks requires a mix of awareness, verification procedures, and secure communication practices. Follow these best practices:

#### Verify Caller Identity
- Always verify the caller's identity before sharing sensitive information.
- Call back using an official number from a trusted source rather than the one provided by the caller.

- Use services like STIR/SHAKEN to detect spoofed phone numbers.

#### Limit Information Disclosure
- Avoid sharing personal, financial, or login details over the phone unless absolutely necessary.
- If a caller claims to be from a bank or organization, verify through official channels.

#### Educate Employees and Users
- Conduct training sessions on recognizing vishing scams and social engineering tactics.
- Simulate vishing attacks to assess awareness and preparedness.

#### Monitor and Report Suspicious Calls
- Encourage employees and users to report suspicious calls.
- Maintain a record of fraudulent phone numbers and share them with security teams.
