A phishing email is a deceptive message sent by attackers to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal data. These emails often appear to be from trusted sources, like banks, well-known companies, or government agencies, and may include urgent language to pressure recipients into taking immediate action. Phishing emails typically contain links to fake websites that mimic legitimate ones or include malicious attachments. Once the user interacts with these links or downloads the attachments, attackers can steal information, install malware, or gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts. The goal is to exploit human trust and curiosity to compromise security.

### How to Identify Phishing Emails

1. Check the Sender's Email Address – Attackers use addresses resembling legitimate ones (e.g., `support@paypaI.com` instead of `support@paypal.com`).
2. Look for Generic Greetings – Phishing emails use vague greetings like “Dear Customer” instead of your name.
3. Hover Over Links – Without clicking, check the actual URL to see if it matches the company’s official website.
4. Watch for Urgent Language – Phrases like “Immediate action required” pressure users into acting quickly.
5. Check for Spelling and Grammar Errors – Poorly written emails often indicate phishing.
6. Avoid Downloading Unexpected Attachments – Phishing emails may carry malware-infected attachments.
7. Beware of Unusual Requests – Companies rarely request sensitive information over email.
8. Check for Unusual Redirections – Be cautious if asked to update account info via an unfamiliar site.
9. Be Skeptical of High-Value Promises – Offers of large rewards or lottery winnings are often scams.
10. Look for Poor Logo Quality or Inconsistent Branding – Fake emails may have blurry logos and unprofessional formatting.
11. Examine the Reply-To Address – It may differ from the "From" address in phishing attempts.
12. Verify with the Company Directly – Contact customer support via official channels to confirm legitimacy.
