## What Are Indicators of Compromise?
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are forensic artifacts or pieces of evidence that suggest a system has been breached or is under attack. Security analysts use IoCs to detect, investigate, and mitigate cyber threats before they escalate.

IoCs provide critical insight into malicious activity, enabling organizations to identify and respond to security incidents in real-time. They are commonly used in threat intelligence, digital forensics, and incident response (DFIR) to link an attack to a known threat actor or malware family.

### Types of IoCs
IoCs can be classified into different categories based on the evidence they provide. Below are the most common types along with examples and their intelligence value:

#### 1. Network-Based IoCs
These IoCs help detect suspicious network activity and unauthorized connections.

| IoC Type       | Example | Intelligence Value |
|--------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Malicious IPs | `192.168.1.10` (Used in botnet traffic) | Can help block attacker-controlled servers. |
| Domain Names | `malicious-site.com` (Phishing site) | Useful for detecting phishing and malware C2 infrastructure. |
| Unusual Traffic Patterns | High outbound data transfer to unknown IPs | May indicate data exfiltration or beaconing activity. |
| DNS Requests to Malicious Domains | Requests to `xyzmalware.com` | Suggests C2 communication or malware activity. |

---

#### 2. Host-Based IoCs
These indicators appear on compromised endpoints (workstations, servers, or mobile devices) and help detect infections at the device level.

| IoC Type | Example | Intelligence Value |
|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| Suspicious File Hashes | `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e` (MD5 hash of malware) | Helps verify if a known malware sample is present. |
| Unusual Processes | `powershell.exe -enc ZgBvAG8ALgBlAHgAZQ` | Can indicate fileless malware or exploitation attempts. |
| Unexpected Registry Changes | `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\bad.exe` | Sign of persistence mechanisms used by attackers. |
| Unauthorized User Accounts | New admin account: `hacker_admin` | Can indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. |

---

#### 3. Email-Based IoCs
Email remains a primary attack vector for phishing and social engineering attacks.

| IoC Type | Example | Intelligence Value |
|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| Phishing Email Headers | `From: ceo@legitbank.com` `Reply-To: attacker@malicious.com` | Can indicate email spoofing and impersonation attempts. |
| Malicious Email Attachments | `invoice.pdf.exe` (double extension) | Commonly used in spear phishing to deliver malware. |
| Suspicious URLs in Emails | `http://secure-login.xyzbank.com` | May lead to credential-harvesting phishing sites. |
| DMARC/SPF/DKIM Failures | Email from `hr@company.com` fails SPF check | Can indicate email domain spoofing. |

---

#### 4. Behavioral IoCs
These are activity-based indicators that reveal anomalies in system or user behavior.

| IoC Type | Example | Intelligence Value |
|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| Login Attempts from Unusual Locations | US-based employee logs in from Russia | May indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access. |
| High Volume of Failed Login Attempts | 1000 failed attempts from one IP in 10 minutes | Sign of brute-force attacks on user accounts. |
| Abnormal File Access | Large volume of sensitive files accessed at midnight | May indicate insider threats or exfiltration attempts. |
| Unusual Application Execution | `cmd.exe /c echo malcode | base64 -d | bash` | Suggests command injection or obfuscated script execution. |

### How IoCs Are Used in Cybersecurity
IoCs play a vital role in multiple cybersecurity functions:

- Threat Detection – Identifying potential intrusions using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.
- Incident Response – Investigating security breaches by analyzing logs and forensic data.
- Threat Intelligence – Correlating IoCs with known threat actor behavior.
- Automated Threat Hunting – Using IoCs in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and firewalls to block threats proactively.

Threat intelligence platforms such as [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/), and [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/) help security teams share and verify IoCs in real-time.

### Best Practices for Handling IoCs
To maximize the effectiveness of IoCs, organizations should:
✅ Continuously update threat intelligence feeds to include the latest IoCs from trusted sources.  
✅ Correlate IoCs with real-world attacks to avoid false positives and improve detection accuracy.  
✅ Automate detection and response by integrating IoCs with SIEM, IDS, and endpoint protection platforms.  
✅ Use IoCs in conjunction with behavioral analysis to detect zero-day threats and fileless malware.  
✅ Share IoCs with industry peers and CERTs to strengthen collective defense strategies.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are essential for identifying, investigating, and mitigating cyber threats. By leveraging network, host, email, and behavioral IoCs, organizations can strengthen their security posture and improve threat detection capabilities.

By integrating IoCs into threat intelligence workflows, security teams can stay ahead of cyber adversaries and effectively safeguard critical systems and data.
