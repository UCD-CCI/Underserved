Disinformation is the deliberate spread of false or misleading information with the intent to deceive, manipulate public
perception, or influence behavior. Unlike misinformation, which is false information shared without harmful intent, disinformation
is intentionally crafted and distributed to achieve specific objectives, such as political influence, social division, or economic gain. It often spreads through social media, news outlets, and other digital platforms, exploiting emotional responses and confirmation biases to maximize impact.
